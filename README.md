# SpeechToText

This Speech-to-Text converter application allows users to convert spoken language into text using their device's microphone. Users can select the language for speech recognition, start and stop recording, view real-time transcription results, download the converted text, and clear the result display. It is made with HTML for the structure of the page, CSS to make it look nice, and JavaScript with the SpeechRecognition feature that understands your speech and turns it into text.
